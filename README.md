Our AI Agent for AWS Global Hackathon

Project Overview: HealthNav is an AI-driven healthcare triage and navigation system designed to simplify patient access to medical care. It addresses a critical global issueâ€”patients delaying or avoiding care due to confusion about symptoms and healthcare pathways. By leveraging conversational AI, HealthNav provides real-time symptom triage, guides users to appropriate care (clinic, ER, or tele-consult), and automates essential tasks like appointment booking, insurance verification, and reminders.
